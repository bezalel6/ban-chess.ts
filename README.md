A TypeScript wrapper library for implementing the **Ban Chess** variant on top of the `chess.ts` library. In Ban Chess, players must navigate around banned moves - each move is preceded by the opponent banning one of their legal options.

**Key concept**: Bans happen BEFORE moves. The opponent always bans one of your moves right before your turn, limiting your options. This is why Black bans first - they ban a White move before White's opening move.

## Try It Online

In the `gui/` directory of this repo, I've implemented a basic playground to test and experiment with the variant and the library: **[https://bezalel6.github.io/ban-chess.ts/](https://bezalel6.github.io/ban-chess.ts/)**

## Overview

Ban Chess follows this turn sequence:

1. **Black bans**: Black bans one of White's possible opening moves
2. **White moves**: White plays their first move (with Black's ban in effect)
3. **White bans**: White bans one of Black's possible responses
4. **Black moves**: Black plays their first move (with White's ban in effect)
5. **Black bans**: Black bans one of White's next possible moves
6. **White moves**: White plays (with Black's ban in effect)
7. **Pattern continues**: Ban → Move → Ban → Move...

### Key Rules

- **Bans precede moves**: Every move is preceded by the opponent banning one option
- **Bans are square-to-square**: A ban blocks ALL moves from square A to square B (e.g., banning e7-e8 blocks ALL promotions on that square: Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight)
- **Forced bans**: Players must ban a move - they cannot pass. 
- **Black starts**: Black bans first, establishing the pattern of ban-before-move

### Checkmate Condition

The key strategic element: When a king is in check and has only **one legal move** to escape, the opponent can achieve checkmate by banning that single escape move, leaving zero legal moves. The checkmate must be executed - it doesn't happen automatically.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ban-chess.ts
# or
yarn add ban-chess.ts
```

## Dependencies

- `chess.ts@^0.16.2` - Core chess logic and validation
- TypeScript support included

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { BanChess } from 'ban-chess.ts';

// Create a new Ban Chess game
const game = new BanChess();

// Game starts: Black bans a White move (before White has moved at all)
console.log(game.turn); // 'black'
console.log(game.nextActionType()); // 'ban'

// Black bans White's e2-e4 opening BEFORE White's first move
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' } });

// Now White moves (with e2-e4 banned)
console.log(game.turn); // 'white'
console.log(game.nextActionType()); // 'move'
console.log(game.legalMoves()); // e2-e4 is NOT available
game.play({ move: { from: 'd2', to: 'd4' } });

// White bans a Black move BEFORE Black's first move
console.log(game.turn); // 'white' (White does the banning)
console.log(game.nextActionType()); // 'ban'
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e7', to: 'e5' } });

// Now Black moves (with e7-e5 banned)
console.log(game.turn); // 'black'
console.log(game.nextActionType()); // 'move'
console.log(game.legalMoves()); // e7-e5 is NOT available
game.play({ move: { from: 'd7', to: 'd5' } });

// Black bans White's next move BEFORE White moves again
console.log(game.turn); // 'black' (Black does the banning)
console.log(game.nextActionType()); // 'ban'
// Pattern continues: ban-before-move
```

## API Reference

### Core Classes

#### `BanChess`

The main class that extends chess.ts functionality with ban mechanics.

```typescript
class BanChess {
  constructor(fen?: string, pgn?: string);
  
  // Game state
  turn: 'white' | 'black';
  currentBannedMove: Ban | null;
  
  // Core method - handles both bans and moves
  play(action: Action): ActionResult;
  
  // Query methods
  nextActionType(): 'ban' | 'move';
  legalMoves(): Move[];  // Returns moves WITHOUT banned moves
  legalBans(): Move[];   // Returns opponent moves that can be banned
  
  // Game state queries
  inCheck(): boolean;
  inCheckmate(): boolean;
  inStalemate(): boolean;
  gameOver(): boolean;
  
  // State management
  fen(): string;  // Extended FEN with ban state
  pgn(): string;  // Includes ban annotations as comments
  history(): HistoryEntry[];
  reset(): void;
}
```

### Types

#### `Action`
```typescript
type Action = 
  | { move: Move }
  | { ban: Ban };
```

#### `Move`
```typescript
interface Move {
  from: string;    // e.g., 'e2'
  to: string;      // e.g., 'e4'  
  promotion?: 'q' | 'r' | 'b' | 'n';
}
```

#### `Ban`
```typescript
interface Ban {
  from: string;    // e.g., 'e7'
  to: string;      // e.g., 'e8'
  // NO promotion field - bans apply to ALL moves from-to
}
```

#### `ActionResult`
```typescript
interface ActionResult {
  success: boolean;
  action?: Action;
  san?: string;         // Standard Algebraic Notation (for moves)
  error?: string;
  newFen?: string;
  gameOver?: boolean;
  checkmate?: boolean;
  stalemate?: boolean;
}
```

#### `HistoryEntry`
```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  turnNumber: number;
  player: 'white' | 'black';
  actionType: 'ban' | 'move';
  action: Ban | Move;
  san?: string;        // For moves only
  fen: string;         // Position after the action
  bannedMove?: Ban;    // The currently active ban (if any)
}
```

### Understanding Turn Flow

In Ban Chess, the flow follows a strict pattern: before EVERY move, the opponent bans one option. So White's move is preceded by Black's ban, and Black's move is preceded by White's ban. The game tracks whose action it is (ban or move) at each step:

```typescript
const game = new BanChess();

// Query what action is expected
if (game.nextActionType() === 'ban') {
  const bans = game.legalBans();
  console.log(`${game.turn} can ban:`, bans);
  // Player selects a ban...
  game.play({ ban: selectedBan });
}

if (game.nextActionType() === 'move') {
  const moves = game.legalMoves(); 
  console.log(`${game.turn} can move:`, moves);
  // Player selects a move...
  game.play({ move: selectedMove });
}
```

### Advanced Features

#### Extended FEN Format

Ban Chess extends standard FEN notation with a 7th field to track ban state:

```
[standard 6 FEN fields] [ban-state]
```

Ban state field format:
- `b:[from][to]` - Active ban (e.g., `b:e2e4` means e2-e4 is banned)
- `w:ban` - White's turn to ban
- `b:ban` - Black's turn to ban

Examples:
```typescript
// Standard starting position, Black to ban White's first move
"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 b:ban"

// After Black bans e2-e4, White to move (with ban in effect)
"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 b:e2e4"

// After White plays d2-d4, White to ban Black's response
"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1 w:ban"

// After White bans e7-e5, Black to move (with ban in effect)
"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq d3 0 1 b:e7e5"
```

This extension ensures the complete game state can be restored from FEN, including:
- Who is about to ban
- What move is currently banned
- Whether the next action is a ban or a move

#### Game State Analysis

```typescript
const game = new BanChess();

// Check current constraints
if (game.currentBannedMove) {
  console.log('Banned move:', game.currentBannedMove);
}

// Analyze position
if (game.inCheck()) {
  const legalMoves = game.legalMoves();
  if (legalMoves.length === 1) {
    console.log('Only one escape move - opponent can checkmate by banning it!');
  }
}

// Game termination
if (game.gameOver()) {
  if (game.inCheckmate()) {
    const winner = game.turn === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    console.log(`Checkmate! ${winner} wins`);
  } else if (game.inStalemate()) {
    console.log('Stalemate - draw');
  }
}
```

#### PGN Integration

Ban Chess uses standard PGN with ban annotations in comments. This ensures portability - any standard PGN parser can read the moves, while Ban Chess parsers can also extract the ban information:

```typescript
const game = new BanChess();

// Play sequence demonstrating PGN format
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' } });   // Black bans (before White moves)
game.play({ move: { from: 'd2', to: 'd4' } });  // White's 1st move
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e7', to: 'e5' } });   // White bans (before Black moves)
game.play({ move: { from: 'd7', to: 'd5' } });  // Black's 1st move

console.log(game.pgn());
// Output: "1. {banning: e2e4} d4 {banning: e7e5} d5"

// PGN format explanation:
// - {banning: FROM_TO} appears BEFORE the move it affects
// - This shows the ban was in effect when the move was made
// - Standard PGN readers ignore comments, preserving compatibility
// - Ban Chess parsers understand the ban-before-move relationship
```

#### Loading Games

```typescript
// From extended FEN with ban state
const game1 = new BanChess('rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 b:ban');
// Game starts with Black ready to ban

// From FEN with active ban
const game2 = new BanChess('rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 b:e2e4');
// White to move with e2-e4 banned

// From PGN with ban history
const pgn = '1. {banning: e2e4} d4 {banning: e7e5} d5 2. {banning: g1f3} Bf4';
const game3 = new BanChess(undefined, pgn);

// Game state fully restored including ban state
console.log(game3.fen()); // Includes ban state field
console.log(game3.history());
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Game Flow

```typescript
import { BanChess } from 'ban-chess.ts';

const game = new BanChess();

// Opening sequence showing ban-before-move pattern
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' } });    // Black bans BEFORE White's 1st move
game.play({ move: { from: 'd2', to: 'd4' } });   // White's 1st move (e4 banned)
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e7', to: 'e5' } });    // White bans BEFORE Black's 1st move
game.play({ move: { from: 'd7', to: 'd6' } });   // Black's 1st move (e5 banned)
game.play({ ban: { from: 'g1', to: 'f3' } });    // Black bans BEFORE White's 2nd move
game.play({ move: { from: 'c1', to: 'f4' } });   // White's 2nd move (Nf3 banned)

console.log('Position after opening:', game.fen());
console.log('PGN:', game.pgn());
// Output: "1. {banning: e2e4} d4 {banning: e7e5} d6 2. {banning: g1f3} Bf4"
```
