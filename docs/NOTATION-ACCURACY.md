# Ban Chess Notation Accuracy Guide

The ban-chess.ts library provides **100% accurate game state indicators** across all notation formats.

## Notation Formats

### 1. FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) - Extended
```
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 3:e2e4
```
- Standard FEN fields 1-6 unchanged
- **7th field**: Ply number with optional ban (e.g., `3:e2e4` means ply 3 with e2-e4 banned)

### 2. SAN (Standard Algebraic Notation)
**Always includes indicators:**
- `+` for check: `Qh5+`, `Ra8+`, `Nf3+`
- `#` for checkmate: `Qh4#`, `Ra8#`
- `=` for stalemate: `Qg6=`

Examples:
```typescript
game.play({ move: { from: 'd8', to: 'h4' } });
// Returns: { san: "Qh4#", checkmate: true }
```

### 3. BCN (Ban Chess Notation) / SerializedAction
**Format:** `type:fromto[promotion][indicator]`

Examples:
- Basic ban: `b:e2e4`
- Ban causing checkmate: `b:g1h1#`
- Basic move: `m:d2d4`
- Move with check: `m:d8h4+`
- Move with checkmate: `m:d8h4#`
- Promotion with check: `m:e7e8q+`

### 4. PGN (Portable Game Notation)
Includes all indicators and ban annotations:
```
1. {banning: e2e4} d4 {banning: e7e5} d5
2. {banning: d2d4} Nf3 {banning: h7h6} Qh4# 0-1
```

Ban annotations can include indicators when they cause game state changes:
- `{banning: g1h1#}` - Ban causes checkmate
- `{banning: e7e8=}` - Ban causes stalemate

### 5. Unified Action Log
Combines BCN for bans with SAN for moves:
```typescript
game.getActionLog();
// Returns: ["b:e2e4", "d4", "b:e7e5", "Nf3", "b:h7h6", "Qh4#"]
```

## Indicator Detection

The library detects and includes indicators in **three scenarios**:

### 1. Moves causing game states
- Check: When a move puts the opponent's king in check
- Checkmate: When a move leaves opponent with no legal moves while in check
- Stalemate: When a move leaves opponent with no legal moves while not in check

### 2. Bans causing game states
- When banning the only escape from check → `#`
- When banning the only legal move (not in check) → `=`
- When opponent remains in check after ban → `+`

**Implementation:** See `BanChess.ts` lines 243-257

### 3. Promotion scenarios
Promotions include both the piece and any resulting indicator:
- `e8=Q+` (SAN)
- `m:e7e8q+` (BCN)

## Configuration

Control where indicators appear:

```typescript
game.setIndicatorConfig({
  pgn: true,          // Include in PGN notation (default: true)
  serialization: true, // Include in BCN/serialized format (default: true)
  san: true           // Include in SAN notation (default: true)
});
```

## Accuracy Guarantees

1. **Consistency**: All formats agree on game state
2. **Completeness**: Every check, checkmate, and stalemate is marked
3. **Ban Detection**: Bans that cause game endings are properly marked
4. **chess.ts Integration**: Leverages proven chess.ts library for move validation

## Examples

### Checkmate Detection
```typescript
// Fool's mate
game.play({ ban: { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' } });
game.play({ move: { from: 'f2', to: 'f3' } });
game.play({ ban: { from: 'd7', to: 'd5' } });
game.play({ move: { from: 'e7', to: 'e5' } });
game.play({ ban: { from: 'd2', to: 'd4' } });
game.play({ move: { from: 'g2', to: 'g4' } });
game.play({ ban: { from: 'h7', to: 'h6' } });
const result = game.play({ move: { from: 'd8', to: 'h4' } });

// All formats show checkmate:
result.san;                      // "Qh4#"
result.checkmate;                 // true
game.getLastActionSerialized();  // "m:d8h4#"
game.pgn();                       // includes "Qh4#" and "0-1"
game.getActionLog();              // last entry is "Qh4#"
```

### Ban Causing Checkmate
When a ban removes the only escape from check, it's marked with `#`:

```typescript
// White king in check with one escape at g1
// Black bans g1-h1, causing checkmate
game.play({ ban: { from: 'g1', to: 'h1' } });
// Returns: { san: "g1h1#", success: true }
// PGN shows: {banning: g1h1#}
// BCN shows: b:g1h1#
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npm test -- notation-indicators.test.ts
```

All 14 test cases verify 100% accuracy across all notation formats.
